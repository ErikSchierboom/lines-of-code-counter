# Synopsis:
# Test the lines of code counter Docker image by running it against a predefined set of 
# solutions with an expected output.
# The Docker image is built automatically.

# Output:
# Outputs the diff of the expected counts against the actual counts
# generated by the lines of code counter Docker image.

# Example:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh

# Iterate over all test directories
